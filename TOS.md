# TERMS OF USE
Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”, “Terms of Use”) carefully before using the Miyukara application (the “Service”) operated by Neclaex (“us”, “we”, or “our”).
Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. Our Service is a Discord bot.
You agree to be bound by these Terms by accessing or using the Service. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you do not have permission to access the Service.

## Availability, Errors, and Inaccuracies
We are constantly updating the product and service offerings on the Service. There may be delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other websites. The information on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mislabeled, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.

Therefore, we reserve the right to change or update information and to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

## Links to Other Websites/Services
Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Neclaex.

Neclaex has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of such companies/individuals or their websites.

You acknowledge and agree that Neclaex shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third-party websites or services.

We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party website or service you visit.

Therefore, we reserve the right to change or update information and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions at any time without prior notice.

## Termination
We may, in our sole discretion and without prior notice or liability, immediately terminate or suspend your access to the Service, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

## Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Neclaex and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees), arising out of a) your use of and access to the Service or b) your breach of these Terms.

## Disclaimer
Your use of the Service is entirely at your risk. The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE". The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.
Neclaex, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and licensors make no warranty that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of the use of the Service will meet your requirements.

## Exclusions
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

## Governing Law
These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with German law, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. These Terms constitute our agreement regarding our Service, and supersede any prior agreements we might have had regarding the Service.

## Changes
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a change is material, we will provide you with at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined in our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after any changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the modified terms. You may no longer use the Service if you do not agree to the new terms.
